## üöÄ Project Overview

This project addresses the critical need for reliable communication in electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft. The entire command and control system depends on a stable communication link, where even short disruptions can pose significant safety risks.

This application uses a trained Random Forest model to analyze simulated real-time telemetry data and predict whether the communication link is healthy or experiencing an anomaly. The goal is to provide an early warning system that can detect link degradation *before* a catastrophic failure occurs.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Real-Time Anomaly Prediction:** Enter live telemetry values and get an instant prediction on the link's health.
-   **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for simulating various link conditions.
-   **High-Recall Model:** The underlying Random Forest model was specifically tuned to maximize **Recall (81.0%)**, prioritizing the detection of every potential anomaly.
-   **Model Transparency:** The dashboard displays the champion model's key performance metrics (Precision, Recall, Accuracy).
-   **Feature Explanations:** Clear captions for each input explain its significance in communication systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Was Built (Tech Stack)

-   **Data Generation & Analysis:** Python, NumPy, Pandas
-   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, LightGBM (for model comparison), Joblib (for model serialization)
-   **Frontend Dashboard:** Streamlit
-   **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud & GitHub

## ü§ñ The Machine Learning Workflow

The model was developed through a systematic, end-to-end machine learning process:

1.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** A high-quality, balanced dataset of 40,000 data points was programmatically generated to simulate five distinct communication scenarios:
    -   Normal Operation (Healthy Link)
    -   Gradual Degradation (e.g., increasing distance)
    -   Sudden Interference (e.g., jamming)
    -   Intermittent Faults (e.g., multi-path fading)
    -   Synchronization Issues (e.g., receiver fault)

2.  **Model Bake-Off:** Three different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM) were trained and evaluated to find the most promising candidate. The Random Forest was selected for its robust performance.

3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` was used to fine-tune the Random Forest model. Critically, the model was optimized specifically for **Recall**, ensuring it was as vigilant as possible in catching failures.

4.  **Feature Importance:** Analysis of the final model revealed that **EVM (Error Vector Magnitude)** and **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** were the most important features, confirming that the model's logic aligns with communications engineering principles.
